I am working alone for this assignment so my contribution is 100%. All the models and code are created by me.

# Design Pattern Improvements

Factory
- With the addition of the flyweight projectiles, the [ammo factory](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/Factories/ProjectileFactory.cs) now has the option to spawn [flyweight](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/BulletFlyweight.cs) or the [original projectiles](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/Bullet.cs) which helps me with showing the performance impact when I'm doing the profiling part
- Originally, had factories for the [Weapons](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/Factories/WeaponFactory.cs) and [Alerts](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/Factories/AlertFactory.cs)

Observer
- No changes
- Used to [notify](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/UserInterface/HUD/AlertObserver.cs) HUD when [player is out of ammo](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/ObserversAndSubjects/WeaponSubject.cs)

Command
- No changes
- Reiterating, it was used to [store equipped weapons](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/Commands/EquipCommand.cs) for undoing
- [Stored in a list so that I could limit the undo steps](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/CommandPattern/CommandInvoker.cs)

Singleton
- No changes
- [HUD Manager](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/UserInterface/HUD/HUDManager.cs) and [Item Manager](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/ItemManager.cs)
- Useful because I want easy access to them similar to that of static classes, but static classes can't have serializable fields 
- They use serializable fields for me to hold game objects like weapons, attachments, ammo types, and menus for other classes to access

Optimization
- Flyweight bullet takes values from [AmmoType scriptable object](https://github.com/JzmingLi/ShooterFramework/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/WeaponFramework/ScriptableObjects/AmmoType.cs)

DLL
- I created a C# DLL that contains the methods for calculating recoil
- Theoretically this would allow the recoil behaviour to be changed through changing the DLL

Profiling
- Flyweight reduced bullet script memory usage by 8 bytes


# The Scenario
The purpose of the scenario is to provide a demo for a feature-rich, reusable FPS game framework I'm creating for the individual project assignment in GDW 5. 
The framework itself is the focus of the scenario, having features such as a modular weapon system and varying types of ammunition.
The user lacks a concrete goal to accomplish, but the scene will provide item spawners and dummies to allow them to explore the frameworkâ€™s features.
The final build only has weapon customization, procedural recoil, and shooting and aiming.
