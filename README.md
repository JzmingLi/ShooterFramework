# Team 8 - James Li 100876994
I am working alone for this assignment so my contribution is 100%. All the models and code are created by me.

# What was done and how?
The current build contains the following features:
- HUD and prefab managers implemented using the singleton design pattern
- A weapon modification menu that allows players to a create a weapon from one rifle, two sights, and two magazines. This was implemented using the factory design pattern and uses the singleton managers.
- An undo system that can revert the player's weapon back to a previously equipped weapon made in the weapon modification menu. This was done using the command design pattern.
- A HUD notification appears when the player runs out of ammo. This was done using the observer design pattern.

A more in depth explanation is included in the video of my submission.

# The Scenario
The purpose of the scenario is to provide a demo for a feature-rich, reusable FPS game framework I'm creating for the individual project assignment in GDW 5. 
The framework itself is the focus of the scenario, having features such as a modular weapon system and varying types of ammunition.
The user lacks a concrete goal to accomplish, but the scene will provide item spawners and dummies to allow them to explore the frameworkâ€™s features.
